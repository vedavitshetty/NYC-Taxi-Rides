# NYC Taxi Rides

This project uses the NYC Taxi Rides dataset to predict ride duration

It can be broken down into four parts:

### Data Wrangling
   - Querying for data from a database using SQL
   - Basic data cleaning using SQL/Pandas
### EDA, Visualization, Feature Engineering
  - Exploratory data analysis of the NYC Taxi dataset
  - Generate visualizations to gain insight on the dataset
### External Datasets
  - Exploratory data analysis of the NYC accidents dataset
  - Join the taxi dataset with NYC accidents dataset, make connection and observation
### Feature Engineering and Model Fitting
  - Feature engineering based on gained insights
  - Modeling with sklearn data pipelines
